Separate buildings for credits (to pay wages) and minerals (to build ships).
Ships and units will have upkeep cost in credits based (unit size or crew size).
Tax agencies will provide credits and mining facilities will provide minerals.
Potentially other buildings to boost population/economy and thus tax income.
Orbital bombardment in lieu of land battle option; decimates population/economy.

Bugs:
If heading is -3pi/4 and we direct to move to a heading at 3pi/4, rotation
direction is incorrect.

Sometimes we just completely fly off the screen, need to test more to determine
when this occurs.

Currently there is nothing stopping the objects from leaving the area.

Improvements:
Should be more lenient in terms of the difference between the current heading
and the heading of the destination so we can keep moving even if the angle needs
some further adjustment.
