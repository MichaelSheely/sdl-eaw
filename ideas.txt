Separate buildings for credits (to pay wages) and minerals (to build ships).
Ships and units will have upkeep cost in credits based (unit size or crew size).
Tax agencies will provide credits and mining facilities will provide minerals.
Potentially other buildings to boost population/economy and thus tax income.
Orbital bombardment in lieu of land battle option; decimates population/economy.
